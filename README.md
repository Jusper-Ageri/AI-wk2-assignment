# 🌍 Carbon Emission Predictor (SDG 13: Climate Action)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions based on GDP, population, and energy consumption.  
It aligns with **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)** — helping governments and organizations track and reduce emissions.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Python IDE

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. The model reads a dataset (`carbon_emissions.csv`).
2. Features used: GDP, Population, and Energy_Consumption.
3. Trains a **Linear Regression model** to predict CO2_Emissions.
4. Outputs **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and a plot comparing actual vs predicted emissions.

## 🧠 Ethical Reflection
- **Bias:** The dataset may not represent all regions equally, especially developing countries.
- **Fairness:** Encourages sustainable planning and global responsibility.
- **Sustainability:** Promotes data-driven environmental policy-making.
